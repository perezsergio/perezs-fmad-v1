    "\n",
    "+ Gather some basic information about the data set: how many observations are there, what are the variables and their types,...\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Check for missing data. If there are any, first obtain the row numbers and variables in which they appear. Then remove those rows from the table. Make sure to rename the resulting table (after the removal) again as `frami` and use this table to answer the following questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ If there are factor variables in the table convert them to the appropriate Python type.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Perform a detailed exploratory analysis of a selection of variables of your choice. This analysis should cover all the types of variables in this table. That is, you should at least study one variable for each type of variable present in the table (but you don't need to study all the variables). The analysis should contain:\n",
    "  - For quantitative variables (continuous or discrete):  \n",
    "    - Basic numeric summary (mean, median, quartiles, sd).  \n",
    "    - Graphics (the right ones for that type of data, possibly more than one graph per variable).  \n",
    "  - For factors :  \n",
    "    - Frecuency tables (absolute and relative).  \n",
    "    - Graphics (bar plot).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Create a new column called `ageGroup` dividing (binning) age in these three levels:\n",

    "    (0,40], (40,55], (55,100]\n",

    "+ Use Python to compute the following probabilities.  \n",

    "\n",
    "+ Run a simulation using Python to confirm your results of the previous question. That is, take $N = 100000$ samples of size $10$ from the table and use them to obtain an estimate of the requested probabilities. Use the random number generator features to make your simulation code reproducible; that is, when we run your code we should get exactly the same results. \n",
